        <h1>React and Redux</h1>
        <p>React and Redux are often mentioned together, and with good reason. The developer who created Redux was a React developer who wanted to make it easier to share data across different components.

Now that you know how to manage the flow of shared data with Redux, it's time to combine that knowledge with React. In the React and Redux courses, you'll build a React component and learn how to manage state locally at the component level, and throughout the entire application with Redux.</p>
